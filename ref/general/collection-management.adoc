The Kabanero project provides solution architects with the ability to manage  integrated collections. Kabanero organizes artifacts into a collection that specifies an Appsody stack, pipelines based on Tekton with “Build Task Definitions”.

Kabanero Collections are logical collections, stored and managed in a Github repository. During the development phase, the collection seamlessly empowers developers to build applications and microservices to the architect’s standard configuration. Collections allow standardization and customization.  Two examples are pipeline tasks and ability to define specific maintenance levels of the application runtimes and frameworks.

The architect or operations teams activates a collection in a given namespace using the Kabanero operator. The collection activation creates a collection instance and prepares the Kabanero Foundation for managing the build, test, and deployment of the microservice.

Soon we’ll be releasing a Collection spec that will describe it in much more detail.  Stay tuned.  Today, Kabanero defines a single Kabanero Collection to demonstrate the concept and is located here. You may note that the Kabanero collection is schema compatible with Appsody such that the developer can use a Kabanero Collection as an Appsody Stack.

The Kabanero Project expects to publish six featured collections with Java, Node, Swift and Spring runtimes and frameworks that allow developers to quickly build apps for Kubernetes including microservices that automatically policies set by your architects and operations teams.  In addition to the six featured collections, we expect many more collections and variations of those featured collections providing even more choice for teams.
