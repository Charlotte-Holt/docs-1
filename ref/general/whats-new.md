title: What's New In Kabanero v0.2.0
---

Today you can get your hands on the next monthly release of Kabanero, v0.2.0.  We’re working towards delivering on a monthly cadence so stay tuned to what November and December bring as well.  We’ve been busy making a ton of improvements including new features, enhancements, and good old fashion bug fixes.  

One focus area for this release is enhancements for the Architect persona to better support customizations for the enterprise.  A new feature we’d like to mention is a Kubernetes Application Navigator that assists with managing microservice composed applications, which aligns with how the Kubernetes SIG-apps describe applications.  Check out all the details on everything new in our [What's New in 0.2.0 blog post](/blog/2019/10/20/WhatsNew020.html).
