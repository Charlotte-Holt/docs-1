== Errors when using a Tekton webhook to trigger pipelines

When using a Tekton webhook to trigger pipelines installed with Kabanero, the last task is the `monitor-result-task`, which may fail in some cases. 
This might also cause the webhook pod to be in the "Error" state. The following failures of `monitor-result-task` in the TaskRun view can be disregarded 
at this time; they do not impact the application deployment:

* `error creating GitHub client: error parsing PR number: pulls`
* `IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/workspace/pull-request/pr.json'`
